The underlying dataset is called 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set' and can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Further description of the data and the collection process:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

#Variables
##Relevant variables of the data are the following:

30 subjects
6 activities (labels)
561 features
10299 datasets of features (divided in a train and test dataset), each belonging to a subject and an activity
#Process
*1.- Dowload the data to a local location
*2.- Read all relevant data into memory
*3.- Merge the train and test data observations of the features with their respectives subjects
*4.- Filtering out the not needed features (keeping only Mean and Standard Deviation)
*5.- Rename the feature columns to be more descriptive
+6.-Based on the tidy data set, create a 2nd tidy data set which shows the average of each feature for each activity and each subject, respectively
